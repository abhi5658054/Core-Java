As part of this week's assignment, you're supposed to build a restaurant application over the course of 3 assignments which has the following
- A Dishes class showing the list of dishes
- A orders class showing the list of orders
- A vegtype class (for declaring dishtype ENUM)
- A Restaurant Class
- A ExceptionHandling class


Kindly use Scanner class for accepting user inputs, Generics, Exception handling, Iterator 
The package structure should be as below 

        com.week4.restaurant.model 
                Order.java 
                Dish.java 
                VegType.java
        com.week4.restaurant.controller
                Restaurant.java
        com.greatlearning.fsd.module4.exceptions
                InvalidAmountException.java 

1. Create a Restaurant class with a main method. Once the option is selected from
   the above, display the dishes and ask the user to select the dish Id to order

    Create a class named InvalidAmountException which is a Unchecked exception.
   =================Please select the Dish Id and hit enter===============================
    Dish Id:5, name: Neer-Dosa, Price: 50.00  Calories: 100
    Dish Id:2, name: Idli-Vada, Price: 40.00  Calories: 200
    Dish Id:4, name: Roti-Curry, Price: 100.00  Calories: 250
    Dish Id:1, name: Dosa, Price: 50.00  Calories: 300
    Dish Id:3, name: Pulav, Price: 80.00  Calories: 330
   ============================================================
    4 (Assume user entered 4)
    output: 
    ==========You have selected Roti-Curry =====================
      Please enter your name: 
    (wait for user input) 
      
    Please pay the bill of Rs 100.00 (wait for user input)

Case -1 
    200 (Assume user entered 200)

    Output:
    ========Thanks for your order. Please collect the change = Rs 100 ================

Case 2

    100 (Assume user entered 100)

    Output:
    ========Thanks for your order. ================

Case 3

    50 (Assume user entered 50)
        throw an instance of InvalidAmountException with the message - Amount paid is less than bill amount.

    Output:
    ========Amount paid is less than Bill Amount ================

For the question above, please use Scanner class for accepting user inputs, Generics, Exception handling, Iterator 
The package structure should be as below 

        com.greatlearning.fsd.module4.model 
                Order.java 
                Dish.java 
                VegType.java
        com.greatlearning.fsd.module4.controller
                Restaurant.java
        com.greatlearning.fsd.module4.exceptions
                InvalidAmountException.java 

Submission format:
- Zip file with the name "Week 4 Assignment 2.zip" which contains the package structure as described earlier
