s part of this week's assignment, you're supposed to build a restaurant application over the course of 3 assignments which has the following
- A Dishes class showing the list of dishes
- A orders class showing the list of orders
- A vegtype class (for declaring dishtype ENUM)
- A Restaurant Class
- A ExceptionHandling class


Kindly use Scanner class for accepting user inputs, Generics, Exception handling, Iterator 
The package structure should be as below 

        com.week4.restaurant.model 
                Order.java 
                Dish.java 
                VegType.java
        com.week4.restaurant.controller
                Restaurant.java
        com.greatlearning.fsd.module4.exceptions
                InvalidAmountException.java 

1. Create a list of Dishes and store it in a ArrayList. Then write Lamdbas
    expressions to sort the dishes based on below criterias 

    a. Sort the dishes in the increasing order of calories 
    b. Sort the dishes in the decreasing order of calories
    c. Sort the dishes in the increasing order of price 
    d. Sort the dishes in the decreasing order of price 

    The Dish class should have 
        id (int)
        name, 
        dishType (can be either Veg or Non_Veg using ENUM)
        calories (double)
        price (double)

    Also override equals, hashcode, toString methods 

2. After creating the above use case, in the main method, provide options for the
   user to select from using Scanner class. The output should be in the below format 

   =================Welcome=====================
   Please choose from the below options 

   1 => To sort the dishes in the increasing order of calories
   2 => To sort the dishes in the decreasing order of calories
   3 => To sort the dishes in the increasing order of price
   4 => To sort the dishes in the decreasing order of price 
   ===============================================


   The screen should wait for the user input and based on the option 
   provided, it should display the dishes in the correct order based on
   the option provided 

   hint: Implement Comparable interface

Submission format:
- Zip file with the name "Week 4 Assignment 1.zip" which contains the package structure as described earlier
